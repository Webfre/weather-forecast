## Tech

Todo List uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [react] - React is an open source JavaScript library for creating external user interfaces.
- [react-toastify] - React-Toastify allows you to add notifications to your app with ease. No more nonsense!
- [web-vitals] - The library is a tiny (~1.5K, brotli'd), modular library for measuring all the Web Vitals metrics on real users, in a way that accurately matches how they're measured by Chrome and reported to other Google tools (e.g. Chrome User Experience Report, Search Console's Speed Report).
- [luxon] - Library for working with dates and times in JavaScript.
- [ESlint] - ESLint is a tool that helps you analyze JavaScript code, find syntax errors and automatically correct them, write neat code in a uniform style according to certain rules.
- [Prettier] - Prettier is a code formatting tool that aims to use hard‚Äîcoded rules for the design of programs. It formats the code automatically.
